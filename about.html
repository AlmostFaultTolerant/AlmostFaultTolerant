        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a data scientist with a strong background in statistics and machine learning. I graduated from Allegheny College with a degree in Data Science and a minor in Psychology. My passion lies in extracting insights from data and using them to drive decision-making.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working on several projects, including GPTA+, a tool designed to enhance AI teaching methods. This project aims to make lessons more engaging and effective for learners. You can find the development logs <a href="https://animated-adventure-wgg69rk.pages.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy collaborating with teams and communicating complex data findings to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
