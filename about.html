        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a senior at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA, majoring in Data Science and minoring in Psychology.

           I have a passion for learning and working with data, as reflected by my past projects.

              I am currently developing GPTA+, a tool to help AI developers improve AI teachers such that their lessons are more engaging and effective. You can find the development logs <a href="https://animated-adventure-wgg69rk.pages.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
